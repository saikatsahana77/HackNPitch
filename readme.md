- Backend: Backend consists of Python programming Language and the main module that powers the server is flask which is a microframework written in Python to create web servers easily and quickly. Also the second important module used in sqlite that handles the sqlite database opeartions. Also apart from flask,sqlite and their helper methods, we are also using email, smtplib and ssl modules for sending password reset and email confirmation emails, opencv, numpy and pillow modules for processing images of uploaded books/ materials, instamojo_wrapper for handling the instamojo payment gateway integrated in our website. Also other core python modules like os (to set path of images uploaded) and random and math modules (to create a random otp and random file names) are used.
